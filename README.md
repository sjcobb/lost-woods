# The Lost Woods

The Lost Woods is a way to navigate between and explore WebVR demos auditorily.

If anyone would like to collaborate (Hyrule is plenty big), just let me know. I am currently working on implementing an item inventory (using browser cookies) that we can share between games.

## Getting Started
Like most things on the web, there isn't one best way to go about creating a WebVR experience. Here are some suggestions for getting started.

- [WebVR Boilerplate](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate) - Starting point for cross-platform web-based VR experiences.
- [FirstPersonVRControls](https://github.com/brianpeiris/three-firstperson-vr-controls) - Helpful implementation of first-person controls.
- [Three.js Examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) - Check them all out, especially the ones under webvr and misc.
- [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe) - A-Frame is a WebVR framework using three.js. It abstracts away a lot of the basic setup and uses an HTML-like syntax. I haven't personally used it on my demos, but it seems really cool.
- [WebVR Starter Kit](https://github.com/povdocs/webvr-starter-kit) - I also haven't used this much, but it seems to have everything you'd need to get going.
- [Awesome WebVR](https://github.com/wizztjh/awesome-WebVR) - more links

## Future Plans
There are a few places online with [curated lists](http://vrlist.io/) of VR experiences, I want the Lost Woods to serve that purpose but keep the user immersed. Another difference is I want to include all types of demos, no matter how half-baked. As the number grows, I will sort them by popularity (or some other criteria).

I also want to explore sharing gameplay elements between sites. For example, you find a key in my game that unlocks a door in your game. I am exploring this now in the [Fire Temple](https://github.com/sjcobb/fire-temple), but it isn't complete yet.

## Issues
Pull requests are welcome. All I currently have to test with is a Google Cardboard headset so I could use help supporting the higher end VR systems.
